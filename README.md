## About Aozora
Aozora is a primarily Japanese language learning utility bot, with currently planned features including:
<ul>
  <li>word and sentence translation using DeepL</li>
  <li>the ability to un-kanji a Japanese sentence</li>
  <li>dictionary searching using Jisho (WIP)</li>
  <li>Hangeul to Romaji (WIP)</li>
  <li>saving searched/translated words to a user dictionary (WIP)</li>
  <li>links to native speaker sound files from Forvo (WIP)</li>
  <li>Korean dictionary searching (WIP)</li>
</ul>

Plans for the client app (all WIP) currently include:
<ul>
  <li>Google/Apple OAuth, link Discord account after sign-in<sup>1</sup></li>
  <li>export user dictionary as CSV for use in Anki, Memrise(?), From Zero</li>
  <li>study saved words via normal flash cards or SRS flash cards</li>
  <li>grapheme/kanji writing practice</li>
  <li>skribbl.io but as the above</li>
  <li>study streaks</li>
</ul>
<sup>1</sup>afaik Discord will send unverified emails through their OAuth, so to prevent hijacking of Aozora accounts a secure sign-in will first be required to then link Discord accounts.
